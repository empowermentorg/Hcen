        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          This project was built in memory of a close friend who was part of the industry and is no longer with us. Her loss reminds us why this work matters. As a Native-led initiative, HCEN also reflects the strength and survival of communities that have long been overlooked.
